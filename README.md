To get started with the EIC REST SDK, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8
- Apache Maven
- Update your Maven settings.xml file to include credentials for GitHub Packages, if you haven't already done so. You can follow the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry) for instructions on how to set up authentication for GitHub Packages in Maven.

### Installation
You can include the EIC REST SDK in your Maven project by adding the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.vivek9237.eic.restsdk</groupId>
  <artifactId>eic-sdk-java</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
> **_NOTE:_**   For more information, see [EIC=SDK-JAVA Package](https://github.com/vivek9237/eic-sdk-java/packages/2144093)

### Environment Variables
To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

- `EIC_TENANT` EIC tenant name

- `EIC_REFRESH_TOKEN` EIC API Refresh Token


## Sample SDK Usage
### Sample Java program

This sample code demonstrates the usage of the EIC REST SDK.
It initializes EicClient with tenant, username, and password, attempts to retrieve user information for a specified username.

#### App.java
```Java
import io.github.vivek9237.eic.restsdk.EicClient;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import java.util.Map;

public class App {
    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(SampleUsage.class.getName());
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        try {
            //Fetch all the environment variables
            Map<String, String> envVariables = System.getenv();
            // Creating an instance of the EicClient class with tenant, and refreshToken parameters
            EicClient eicClient = new EicClient(envVariables.get("EIC_TENANT"), envVariables.get("EIC_REFRESH_TOKEN"));
            // Attempting to retrieve user information for the username "admin"
            System.out.println(eicClient.getUserByUsername("admin"));
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handling Exception by printing the stack trace
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
## Roadmap
